- Integration with a messaging platform: The bot can be integrated with various messaging platforms such as Telegram, Slack, or Facebook Messenger.
- Button click detection: The bot listens for button clicks from users.

## Setup

To set up the Button Click Bot project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/button-click-bot.git
   $ cd IdFindbot
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using your preferred package manager. For example, using npm:

   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

3. Configure the bot to work with your chosen messaging platform. This typically involves creating an account and obtaining an API key or access token. Refer to the documentation of your chosen platform for more details.

4. Update the configuration file with your platform-specific settings. You can find the configuration file at `env`:

   Replace `<TOKEN>` with the name of your messaging platform and `<api-key>` with your API key or access token.

5. Customize the bot's behavior (optional). You can modify the bot's responses or add additional functionality by editing the `bot.js` file.

## Usage

To run the IDFind bot, execute the following command:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Once the bot is running, it will start listening for button clicks from users on the configured messaging platform. When a user clicks the button, the bot will retrieve their user ID and display it in the console or perform any other desired action as defined in the `bot.js` file.
